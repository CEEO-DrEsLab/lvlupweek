Our final project consisted of two separate parts and programs. The first which was present in the prototype was the free play beeping box. This part of the project contain two parts, the main control panel box and the speed box. The main control panel consisted of a ultrasonic sensor, two touch sensors, a wheel attached to a motor, and a lever also attached to a motor. The Ultrasonic sensor was used to change the pitch based on how high you moved your hand. The two touch sensor fooled with the octaves. The top button would change the octave between halving it and multiplying it by various factors, while the bottom button multiplied the octave by 5. Next to that is the wheel attached to the motor which manually changed the octave by turning the wheel. Next to the wheel was a lever attached to a motor which allowed the child to vary the level of volume of the beeping. Next to the orange control panel is another box with an ultrasonic sensor that controls the speed at which the beeps go. The child slides a panel closer and farther from the ultrasonic sensor. The closer it is the faster it goes, and the farther the slower. 

The second program is run from another computer is a color sensor set up in a contraption where you can slide different color blocks to sit on top of the color sensor and a touch sensor. Based on what color is read (Blue, Black, or Green) there are three different songs that can be played: "Mary Had a Little Lamb", "Row Row Row Your Boat" and "Frere Jacque". In order for this to work you place the block over the color sensor then hit the touch sensor five times and that will trigger the program to play the respective song.
