 Our creation is alike to that of Guitar Hero, but for a drumset. Our drumset uses touch and light sensors to communicate with its users. Specifically, the light sensor is used to indicate when a user should tap a specific drum. The touch sensor then records whether or not the user taps the drum within a second of the light sensor indication that it should be touched. If the touch sensor does sense a bump, the computer is then signaled to play an instrumental sound and add ten points to the users score. The user, therefore, receives visual and audio confirmation when he/she is successful. In regard to when the drums were to light up, we had to manually input the time value at which each drum would light up throughout the entire song. Each drum had the potential to earn the user ten points, and we had a total of 84 drum hits (until we had to beat Dan's score by adding another drum..sorry Dan ;)). Our users on test day tried to seriously test our coding by doing things like: pressing every drum down at once, pressing a drum for an extended amount of time, and also tested the drum's structural integrity by slamming on the touch sensors.. But nothing broke, the drums or the code!
