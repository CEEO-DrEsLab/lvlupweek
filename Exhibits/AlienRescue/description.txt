 The objective of our game is to tag all of the aliens hands in order to "bring them home."  The toy uses a joystick which controls a 4-omni-wheeled robot which rolls around on top of a wood "table."  the robot has 4 motors which power the 4 omni-wheels using gear trains to keep distance between the motors and EV3 brick and the large magnet fixed to the underside of the robot.  This magnet holds the "spaceship" to the underside of the "table" using the magnetic attraction between the magnet on the underside of the robot and a magnet on the top of the spaceship.  A laser attached to the bottom of the spaceship allows the pilot to activate the light sensors on the hands of the aliens, thus "bringing them home."
