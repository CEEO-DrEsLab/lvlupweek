Our puppet show is a play, no pun intended, on the Nutcracker. This modern fairytale depicts two, unfortunately headless, male nutcrackers vying for a beautiful ballerina. Each nutcracker consists of one brain, three large motors, one touch sensor, two large wheels, one ball bearing, and various other structural materials for support. The structural support materials build a frame for each nut cracker face and the wheels, brain, and motors allow the nutcrackers to move about freely. The touch sensors allow the nutcrackers to interact with one another physically. While the use of speakers and scripted material allows the nut crackerâ€™s to converse with one another. The ballerina is a lovely static barbie outfitted in the latest and greatest ballet clothing. Also on the set is a Christmas tree and the body of one of the nutcracker men (hence why they are so bitter!).
