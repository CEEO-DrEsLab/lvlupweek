Our toy used different sensors to engage the children. Each sensor had a different animal sound that would play off of the computer once the sensor was activated. The children would get a few trials to see how some of the sensors worked and then they would play to win a prize. If the child guessed 3 animal noises correctly in a row, he/she won a prize.  We used 2 bricks with 2 separate programs and had them run simultaneously on the computer.
